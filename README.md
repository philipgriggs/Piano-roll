# Piano-roll

![piano](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philipgriggs/Piano-roll/master/readme.png)

A project written using Felgo that visualises a midi file on a piano roll. The midi file must be converted to json first (eg using the site https://tonejs.github.io/Midi/). Does not include a sound generator - an mp3 must be supplied. 

The logic is in the [main](https://github.com/philipgriggs/Piano-roll/blob/master/qml/Main.qml) qml file.
